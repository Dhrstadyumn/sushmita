<p>Amidst the loud thunderstorms, there is a strong people&rsquo;s storm that has been gathering momentum in the Himalayan region of Kumaon in Uttarakhand.</p>
<p>In the small village of Satoli in Nainital district, near Mukteshwar, a big battle is being fought by its residents over the past months! A fight to safeguard the environment and resources of the ecologically sensitive Himalayan region. Ultimately, it is a fight for the planet and its survival.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Peaceful dharna against </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>borewell that has been dug for commercial misuse under the garb of residential use</strong></h3>
<p>Today the villagers of Satoli, Peora, Diyari, Chatola, Satkhol, Sitla, and neighboring areas, as well as held a peaceful&nbsp;gathering against a borewell that has been dug for commercial misuse under the garb of residential use at gram Satoli (Patti Malli Kutoli, District Nainital). All established laws, norms and guidelines have been flouted, unleashing a trail of destruction with regards to our water resources.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><storng>Highlighting the issue</storng></h3> In a residential area of Satoli Village, an illegal borewell has been dug and operationalized for commercial purposes causing immense anxiety and anger among the residents. The borewell has been dug by a non-resident of Satoli and under the name of residential use but in practice, the water is being misused and diverted by builders for construction of high-end Villas in Satoli. Interestingly, the same builders have been involved in encroaching upon government land in a nearby village in Chatola. A new permit had been applied after the lapse of a previous one. The permission was given within 24 hours without looking into the ground realities and the change in circumstances in these 10 years. The permission was granted without following the procedure of consulting the villagers, inspection and verification from a special hydrologist, which are important to ascertain the impact of the permission on the Ecology.</p>

<p>The reason for which the first permission was granted, ten years back, does not stand valid anymore. This permission was granted 10 years ago, under the purview of the absence of even a handpump in the concerned location; however, now government pipelines are supplying drinking water and there is no need for a borewell for personal use/ individual use. Moreover, there is already a water supply line at present and yet the borewell permission was granted.</p>

<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>10 years back, the permission for a borewell in gram Satoli was granted for personal use to one Vipin Chandra Pant who does not live Satoli but in Bhowali town, which is 45 km away. Earlier this year, a big builder of the area operationalised the borewell to extract and provide water for their large luxury villas development coming up at gram Satoli. What may have been a small borewell for personal use has now become a massive commercial project as the builder has accordingly done the digging to divert the water for commercial use for construction of the large luxury villas. Regulations regarding the digging, which requires the presence of a geologist and representative government functionary is mandatory, have been flouted.</p>

<p>Gallons and gallons of water&nbsp;are being abstracted daily by the builder. Several households are being impacted by this illegal act. Villages of Satoli, Diyari, Peora, and others, in addition to the present scarcity of water, will face an even more acute water shortage if this rampant misuse is not stopped immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, various important programmes in the area of health, education, livelihood and women empowerment being run by AAROHI, a prominent and reputed NGO in gram Satoli will also be negatively impacted.</p>
<p>It is relevant to point out that the very same builders have been in the eye of the storm for encroaching on government land in the nearby village of &lsquo;Chatola&rsquo;. A PIL, against the encroachment in &lsquo;Chatola&rsquo;, has been filed against the builders in the Nainital High Court and the Court has sent a notice to them, making it incumbent upon them to respond to the charges levelled against them.</p>

<h3><strong>Irreversible damage by digging borewells&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Digging borewells in ecologically sensitive hill areas is a recipe for disaster. Since hilly areas do not have a water table under the surface, borewells draw on all available water channels. The most disturbing aspect of a boring activity in the hills is that it taps into or cuts through the water channels and sucks out the water from the capillaries, ultimately leading to drying up of the water source of villages at lower altitudes.</p>
<p>Dr. Vishal Singh, Executive Director CEDAR expressed his concerns and expertise regarding dissent over usage of borewells. He explains that</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">&ldquo;Springs and streams are the most important sources of water for the people living in the Himalayan region. Over the last few decades, Borewells have become increasingly popular, across the Himalayas. The science behind the connection between Borewell and Springs is not very robust. However, if you go by common logic, it is not lost to anybody that when a Borewell and a spring share a common aquifer and extract water at different rates, the impact on the Springs would be much higher leading to low discharges and eventually drying up. In the Himalayan region, We should focus more towards nature based solutions and our traditional water systems, which have been there for several hundred years. These sustainable practices of extracting water at a faster pace in the name of development should be completely avoided.&rdquo;&nbsp;</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Legal perspective</strong></h3>
<p>Needless to say, groundwater abstraction is highly regulated by law, given the devastating impact it has on the environment. Misuse of groundwaterground water is a punishable offence.</p>
<p>A plethora of judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, National Green Tribunal and High Courts have held that it is the legal obligation of the state to act against those who violate the law and misuse natural resources of the country.</p>
<p>Pertaining to this borewell in gram Satoli, around 150 residents are signatories to letters highlighting this wrong-doing and demanding action from the authorities. Letters have been sent to:</p>
<ol>
<li>State of Uttarakhand Government through the Secretary, Department of Drinking Water &amp; Sanitation, of Uttarakhand, Civil Secretariat, Dehradun- 248001</li>
<li>Central Ground Water Board (Uttaranchal Region) through Regional Director, 41A, Kanwali</li>
</ol>
<p>Road, Baluwala, Near Uria Bhawan Dehradun-248001.</p>
<ol>
<li>District Magistrate, Nainital-263002.</li>
<li>Sub-Divisional Officer/Pargana Magistrate, Nainital-263002.</li>
<li>State of Uttarakhand, through Secretary, Irrigation Department, Dehradun- 248001.</li>
</ol>
<p>The residents feel it is the legal obligation of the State to act against those who violate the law and exploit the country&rsquo;s natural resources. They are demanding justice against this flagrant violation of the laws of the country and have pledged that they will stay united and continue their fight to the end.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">&ldquo; This poses a huge threat to water supply in Satoli and surrounding villages. The future of children who study in the school run by Aarohi, the hospital which provides much needed medical aid to villagers, livelihood programmes which empower people here, all of it stands to be negatively impacted. It is totally against the interest of our people and must be stopped.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<li><strong>Bhim Bisht</strong> from Peora, representing the hope and aspirations of people said that,
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">&ldquo;We the people have to come together and not turn a blind eye to the devastation around us.

I will stand against every such act which is an assault on our natural resources.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<li><strong>Krishan Bhandari</strong>: a local villager / farmer from gram Kafura thanked everyone present at the Dharna and said,
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">&ldquo;If not us residents, then who will stand up against the destruction of our beloved Kumaon. It is tragic to see that an illegal borewell has been dug here in complete disregard of its impact on villagers.&rdquo;</blockquote>
